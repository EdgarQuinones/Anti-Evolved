To be able to make an antivirus that doesn't just **check a database and matches it**, I will need to learn the behavior of malware.

I can see this being a long-term project as there are various forms of malware, with various methods of working. 

### What I Must Learn 
- Looking for **strings** in malware, and finding out what those strings mean 
	- `Strings` method is something that can auto find ASCCI
- Looking for **Assembly Patterns**
	- May need to learn how to read a bit of **Assembly**
- **Hex Patterns**
	- You don't really learn to read it, but maybe you can idk

### Before I Start Anti-Virus
- I am going to need a better understanding on what malware is, and how it works 
- If I want an actual deep scanner, it will involve proper understand of malware


### Break down into smaller pieces 
- Different types of malware attacks 
- Different types of languages
