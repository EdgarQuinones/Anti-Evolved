# Version 1.0 of Anti-Evolved
Step one of this project is coming up with a UI, as it will give us an idea for what we want to add. 
For version 1.0 of the snapshot, we want to keep it simple.
1. Scan based on 1 signature type 
2. Give a result of either true or false 
3. Scans a file the user uploads

## Part 1: UI
- One window 
- Allows user to upload file 
- Software scans file 
- Returns whether or not it is possibly malware based on a preset database of signatures
